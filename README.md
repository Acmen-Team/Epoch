## Getting Started

Visual Studio 2017 or 2019 is recommended, Epoch is officially untested on other development environments whilst we focus on a Windows build.

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/Acmen-Team/Epoch`.

If the repository was cloned non-recursively previously, use `git submodule update --init` to clone the necessary submodules.
